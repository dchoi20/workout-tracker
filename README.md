# Workout Tracker

- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

* Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
